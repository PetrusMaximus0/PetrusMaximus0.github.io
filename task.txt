Tasks to be done:

-Create the page using Tailwind CSS exclusively
-Remove submenus from the "Shop, Blog" navigation
-Remove Carousels from the header and "Recommended items" section
-Remove expandable categories in the "Category" section.
-Remove the "Price range" slider.
-Design a simple look for the shopping cart at the very bottom of the page

The only animation:

When hovering over a product in the "Featured items" section, 
a covering orange block slides down from the top


Javascript written in ES6+ OOP:

-For products in the "Featured items" section, clicking the "Add to cart" button
 will save the product to the cart.

-The ability to add and reduce the quantity of products in the cart will update the cart's
 total price.
